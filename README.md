Bloater Rule Engine and the naming of it was planned to be an implementation of the `json rules engine` that uses json to make rules to automate things with an intial focus on the crypto project Defi Kingdoms. We have mostly moved away from that and are just creating a library for DFK for purposes of automating DFK but currently directly in scripts.
